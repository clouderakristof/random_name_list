# random_name_list

This app was created to generate random list from ranger/knox/atlas sustaining team members for standups

Use the `/mix` endpoint to mix the names and use the `/list` endpoint to check mixed names.

## Improve ideas:

1. Use db instead of file
2. better design for every page
3. More intuitive pages
4. Option to change the lists
5. Authentication, so other teams can use the webapp
