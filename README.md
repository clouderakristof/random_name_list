# random_name_list

This app was created to generate random list from ranger/knox/atlas sustaining team members for standups

Use the `/mix` endpoint to mix the names and use the `/list` endpoint to check mixed names.

##Usage

The app is hsoted on Heroku. You can find the site at this url: https://arcane-lake-90901.herokuapp.com/list

## Improve ideas:

1. Use db instead of file
2. Better and common design for every page
3. More intuitive pages
4. Option to change the lists
5. Authentication, so other teams can use the webapp
6. Tests
7. CI/CD
